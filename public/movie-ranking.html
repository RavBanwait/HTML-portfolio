<h1>Curated List of Entertaining Movies</h1> 
<h2>Top Three
    <hr>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of the greatest science-fictions movies to date, it's as equally intelligent as it is emotional, Highly recommended for a great cinematic experience.</p>
<h3>Godzilla (2014)</h3>
<p>Although many iterations of this franchise have been produced, the CGI has improved so much in last 10 years that the difference has set this one apart. Plus, Bryan Cranston is in it, who doesnt love that guy?<br>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Another cinematic masterpiece to add to the mix, the film alludes to wars brought on poorly-disguised greed (ahem looking at you Mr.States) using some of the most impressive CGI known to man - including their true 3D technology to wow the viewer </p>
